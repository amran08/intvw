#### Yet Another Guide on Interview Prep

- LC -- [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com) 

###### legends
- 🕶 - take a very brief look into the topic, you do not have to grok it
- 🔬 - deep dive into the topic, grok it
- ✨ - if you have time, please understand these topic well
- 🌪 - these topic needs very advanced understanding, if you can learn about those then awesome, 
but realistically I don't expect questions from these topics

### Foreword 
I compiled a interview prep resources list in Fall of 2018. I was not interviewing 
back then, some of my friends were, and I thought I might start accepting interview 
requests later on. I have interviewed with some big names before, but everything 
did not go as planned at those on-site interviews. Hence, I thought, I need to 
change my approach of preparing for interviews. I read a lot of interview prep
guides and used a lot of wonderful resources. In my honest opinion, there is no
point in writing yet another guide on interview prep (abbr. YAGIP); but I am 
writing it down, mostly for my own record. If it turns out to be helpful to 
someone else, then that is a plus.


### Mindset and approach
Having a right mindset is helpful. What is right for you may be different from 
someone else. But, invariably do these:

- Love your current job (or fake it)
- Practice effectively regularly (more on it later)
- Aim high
- Interview with more than a few companies at once
- Always thrive to better yourself


### Role
I am a software engineer, and this note is for interviewing as for 
software engineering roles. Titles vary; but usually:
- Software Engineer
- Software Development Engineer

Often shortened as SE, SWE, SDE etc. For more info visit [level.fyi](http://level.fyi)


### Things to focus on
As a software engineer you need to focus on the following things:

- Your profile (LinkedIn and resume) 
- Your story (what story do you want to tell about yourself to recruiters, mangers and peers)
- Understanding basic data structures and algorithms
- Problem solving and programming skill
- Understanding of software systems (system design, architecture, API design etc.)
- Understanding of software development process and lifecycle (SDLC, Agile, Scrum, CD, CI etc)
- Interviewing (Applying/Getting interview requests and timing)
- Know your worth
- Making a decision


### Profile
Resume is a important thing for applying. But, today, LinkedIn is the most important
form of profile. So, try to polish your LinkedIn profile. Do not add fake info. 
Remove stale info. Proudly showcase what you have done. You have more room to 
list all of your achievements, voluntary works and what not. For each role, also
describe what you worked on, list your projects so on so forth.

I do not know how valued recommendations and endorsements on LinkedIn are, but it 
is definitely nice to have those. 

Resumes should be strictly one page, should have your contact info and list your
relevant jobs and education. Read CSCQ FAQ on [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index#wiki_resumes) and utilize their threads on [resume review](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/search?q=Resume+Advice+Thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).


### Your Story
- What is your elevator pitch? 
- How can you introduce yourself to me in less than five minutes. 
- Can you tell me about you in 15-20 minutes?
- What did you do? What interests you? What are you working on?

Be excited about what you are doing. Be excited about yourself. Exude confidence 
and passion. 
To prepare for this, take some time to reflect on your life and career. Go through 
your good old memories, and if you have access to, through your past projects (their
documentations, demos, videos, presentations, source code -- whatever you have).
Also, if you are currently working, and interviewing as an industry hire, please,
try to understand the bigger picture and architecture of your current project(s).

Also, reflect on any decisions (technical or otherwise) you have made at work or 
for yourself. Do some introspection. Was that a right decision? Why did you make 
those decisions etc. 

Know thyself. 


### DS+Algo
Understanding most used data structures and algorithms is a must. Depending on
how fresh is your knowledge, you may benefit from reading on them. Make sure that
you understand most of the following:

##### Topics
###### DS 
- Arrays, Collections, Dynamic Arrays, Direct Access
- Linked Lists, Doubly LL, Circular LL 
- Stack, Queue, Heap/Priority Queue -- LL & array implementations
- Trees, BSTs, Binary and m-ary trees 
- Graphs
- Hashed map, hashed set etc. 📃 [hash-maps↗](http://shlegeris.com/2017/01/06/hash-maps)

###### Algorithm concepts
🔬 Basics: 
- Sorting, merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, bucket sort etc. 
- Binary search
- Iteration, loop invariant

🔬 Intermediate: 
- Recursion
- Back tracking
- Greedy 

✨ Somewhat Advanced: 
- Dynamic programming, memoization
- Graph traversal, BFS, DFS
- Be familiar with common graph algorithms like Djisktra's, Krushkal's, Prim's, 
Floyd Wasrhall etc. 

🌪 Advanced (you can skip this):
- Maximum flow
- Number theory
- Randomized algorithms
- Cache oblivious algorithms
- Parallel algorithms


###### Related concepts
- Space and time complexity (Big O notations) 📃 [complexity↗](https://discrete.gr/complexity/)
- NP hard, NP complete 🕶 

##### Study
> Everyone has their own style of studying. So, adopt it for yourself. 

These are some books that I have found useful in the past:
- [Sedgewick](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) -- It was my favorite book in college
- [CLRS](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) -- *the* algorithm text book
- [Skiena](http://www.algorist.com/) -- design manual, I keep it on my desk
- [DVP](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html) -- Dasgupta _et al_; ([↗pdf](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf))

But, this time I used the following resources to brush up my understanding of algorithms 

- **💎[Jeff Erickson](http://algorithms.wtf)** -- lecture notes by an UIUC prof, 
now converted into a book. I focused on chapters: 3 to 8
