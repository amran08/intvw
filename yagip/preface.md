### Preface to  YAGIP

I compiled a list of interview prep resources in Fall of 2018. That was a pre-cursor
to my interview preparation. Now, after I am somewhat done with this, I decided 
to write down this note to document how I prepared.

I have interviewed with some big names before, but everything  did not go as 
planned at those on-site interviews. This time I realized, I need to change my 
approach. 

I read some interview prep guides and looked at some wonderful  resources and made 
a plan. A fundamental change I made is that I realized, *preparing for interviews
is not the same as studying for algorithms courses*. In addition, I did not interview
with just one company at once. After I started preparing, I started scheduling interviews.
Nailed most of it, but not all of them. 

In my honest opinion, there is no point in writing 
_**yet another guide on interview prep**_ (abbr. YAGIP); 
but I am  scribing it down, mostly for my own record. If it turns out to be 
helpful to someone else, then that is a plus.
